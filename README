django-gqslpagination provides a paginator for Django QuerySets
returning pages of sorted and grouped objects (i.e, GROUP BY).

The number of objects on a page will be as close as the requested number as
possible. Items from a same group are always on a same page. A single page can
have items belonging to more than one group.
